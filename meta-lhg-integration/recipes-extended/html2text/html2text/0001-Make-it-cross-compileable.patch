Subject: [PATCH] Make it cross-compileable

This version of configure is not friendly for cross-compile.
It doesn't take config options, so we are not able to pass '--host' or
'--target' to it. Move '$CC" to the front of compile candidate list and
pass cross-compile through it when run 'configure' will do the trick.
